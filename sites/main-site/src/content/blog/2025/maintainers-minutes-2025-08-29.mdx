The 'Maintainers Minutes' aims to give further insight into the workings of the [nf-core maintainers team](/governance#maintainers) by providing brief summaries of the monthly team meetings.

## Overview

Summer was actually not over as we only were a small group on that Friday.

We talked briefly about the aftermath of the previous meeting regarding the test datasets.

And then we talked about plans for migrating the code base of modules.

In the end, Maxime as his usual self, showcased what he has been playing around with lately, and demoed nf-core-utils and the particular nf-test setup in sarek.

## The end

All of the above are just starting points for discussions, and we will continue to work on these topics in the coming months.
But we will need a large amount of input from the wider community to ensure the community gets the best experience they want, so we encourage anyone with thoughts and feedback on the above to join the [#wg-test-data-task-force](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C07B5FK9GKA) channel and post their ideas there!

As always, if you want to get involved and give your input, join the discussion on relevant PRs and Slack threads!

\- :heart: from your #maintainers team!
